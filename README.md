## Introduction

This gem has one method: Pathname#dirnames.

It will return an enumerable of pathnames created by calling #dirname repeatedly.

This can be useful for traversing directories upwards to parent, grandparent, etc.

Example:

     p = Pathname.new('/foo/goo/hoo.txt')
     p.dirnames
     #=> ['/foo/goo', '/foo', '/']

## Example to find a file

To find the first occurance of a file named "my.txt" in a path or its parents:

     basename = "my.txt"
     p = Pathname.new('/foo/goo/hoo/*')
     puts p.dirnames.find{|dirname| (dirname + basename).exist?}

Note that the "*" at the end of the pathname is to give dirname something to chop off; the "*" is being used as chaff, not as a file matcher nor string matches.
